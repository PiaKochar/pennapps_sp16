// Call method currently in neighborhood_parser.js to
// get data from the API - remember to use chrome.tabs.executeScript
// that function should do all the work, the call should just
// be here in a mouseclick listener (although if the data is
// surfaced in the popup window, should that be done here since
// this is in scope?)
